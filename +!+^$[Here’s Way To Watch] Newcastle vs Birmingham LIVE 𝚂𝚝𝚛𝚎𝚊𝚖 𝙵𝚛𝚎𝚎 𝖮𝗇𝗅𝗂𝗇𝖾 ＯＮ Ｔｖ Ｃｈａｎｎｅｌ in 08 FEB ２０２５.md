Birmingham City vs. Newcastle lineups, team news
The hosts do not have fresh injury concerns going into this match. Manager Chris Davies would be eager to select the XI which has carried Blues in League One recently.

Their prized recruit, Jay Stansfield, has scored 17 goals in 25 appearances and he will lead the Birmingham attack once again.

Injured: None
Suspended: None

Newcastle will miss Harvey Barnes (muscle), Jamaal Lascelles (ligament) and Joelinton (knee) due to injury.

Birmingham City vs. Newcastle prediction
Despite their unbeaten run, Birmingham City won't go into this clash as the favorites.

Newcastle United are riding a wave of confidence after beating Arsenal at home as well as away in the EFL Cup. Though their hectic schedule may see Howe rotate the squad, the Magpies have enough depth of talent to see Birmingham off.

Prediction: Newcastle 2-0 Birmingham City
