Birmingham City host Newcastle United in the fourth round of the FA Cup tonight, with the League One leaders looking to bring an upset at St Andrew’s.

Chris Davies’ side lead the third division by four points with two games in hand, putting them in a brilliant position ahead of the fourth round. And their advantage in the league means they can afford to put everything into trying to earn a famous upset this weekend.

Live build-up: Birmingham host Newcastle in FA Cup
Newcastle will still be buoyed by their 4-0 aggregate win over Arsenal in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup in midweek, with Eddie Howe’s team booking their place in a second League Cup final win three years.

And a likely much-changed Magpies side will want to get the business done against lower-league opposition as they continue to hunt an end to the club’s 70-year trophy drought.

Here’s everything you need to know:

When is Birmingham vs Newcastle?
The FA Cup fixture will kick off at 5.45pm GMT on Saturday 8 February at St Andrews in Birmingham.

What TV channel is it on?
This fixture will be shown free-to-air on BBC One in the UK, with subscribers also able to watch online via BBC iPlayer. Coverage begins at 5.30pm.

Confirmed line-ups
Birmingham XI: Peacock-Farrell; Laird, Klarer, Davies, Cochrane; Iwata, Leonard; Wright, Dowell, Anderson; Stansfield.

Subs: Allsop, Bielik, Hanley, Sampsted, Harris, Willumsson, Dykes, May, Jutkiewicz.

Newcastle XI: Pope; Livramento, Kraft, Burn, Targett; Bruno G., Longstaff, Miley; Osula, Wilson, Willock.

Subs: Dubravka, Ruddy, Trippier, Schar, Tonali, Isak, Hall, Murphy, Neave.

What is the team news?
Wholesale changes for Newcastle, as was expected coming into today’s clash.

Eddie Howe switches out nine players from their Carabao Cup win over Arsenal in midweek, with ex-Birmingham loanee Dan Burn and skipper Bruno Guimaraes the only players to keep their spot.

Callum Wilson is chosen to lead the line as formidable top scorer Alexander Isak sits on the bench, held in reserve in case of emergency.

As expected, League One record signing Jay Stansfield is back in the starting XI for Birmingham as Chris Davies’ side looks to cause an upset against Premier League opposition.

Ethan Laird, Ben Davies, Tomoki Iwata and Keshi Anderson also make their returns to the lineup.

Odds
Birmingham win - 9/1

Draw - 4/1

Newcastle win - 1/2

Prediction
Even a much-rested Newcastle side should have more than enough for the League One leaders.

Birmingham 0-2 Newcastle.
