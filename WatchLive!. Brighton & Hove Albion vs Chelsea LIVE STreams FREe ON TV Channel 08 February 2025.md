Saturday's action-packed FA Cup schedule ends at the Amex as Brighton host Chelsea in an all-Premier League fourth round tie.

The Seagulls will be looking to respond to their 7-0 hammering at the hands of high flyers Nottingham Forest last weekend, which will have dented their confidence as well as their hopes of a European spot.

An FA Cup run could help turn a good Brighton season into a great one, and they do have history in the competition, having reached the semi-finals twice in the last six seasons.

They cruised to a 4-0 victory over Norwich City of the Championship in the fourth round but will need to step up their game for the visit of the Blues.

Watch Brighton v Chelsea on ITV4
Chelsea produced a spirited comeback to beat rivals West Ham 2-1 on Monday evening to rise to fourth in the Premier League, and now turn their focus back to a competition they have enjoyed in recent years.

The West Londoners won their eighth FA Cup in 2017/18, have reached the final three times since, and made it to the final four last term while they put five past League Two Morecambe last month.

Saturday will be the first of two trips to Brighton in a week for the Blues, who are back at the Amex in the Premier League next Friday.
