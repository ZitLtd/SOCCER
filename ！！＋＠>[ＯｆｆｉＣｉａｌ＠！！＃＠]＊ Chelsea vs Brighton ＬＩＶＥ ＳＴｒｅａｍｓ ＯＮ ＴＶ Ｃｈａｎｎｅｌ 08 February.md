Brighton vs. Chelsea predicted lineups, team news
Brighton's injury list remains extensive. There is a chance that Pervis Estupinan, Mats Wieffer and Solly March could return this weekend, but all three are touch and go.

Otherwise, Carlos Baleba, Yasin Ayari, James Milner, Ferdi Kadioglu, Jason Steele and Igor Julio are continuing their recoveries and only Baleba or Ayari are likely to be ready for this weekend.

Manager Hurzeler will likely make some lineup changes regardless given the manner of their loss at Forest. Simon Adingra and Matt O'Riley may get a start, while Diego Gomez could be in line for his full debut for the Seagulls.

Brighton predicted XI (4-1-4-1, right to left): Verbruggen (GK) — Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, Lamptey — O'Riley — Adingra, Gomez, Pedro, Mitoma — Welbeck

Injured: Kadioglu (ankle/foot), Milner (thigh), Steele (shoulder), Igor Julio (thigh), Baleba (muscle), Ayari (muscle, doubt), Wieffer (thigh, doubt), March, Estupinan (undisc., doubt)
Suspended: None

Chelsea's injury picture is unchanged from Monday's win over West Ham. Omari Kellyman, Romeo Lavia, Wesley Fofana and Benoit Badiashile are all still sidelined, while Mykhailo Mudryk remains suspended following a failed doping test.

Filip Jorgensen is likely to keep his place in goal ahead of Robert Sanchez, but Maresca is expected to make a few changes. Pedro Neto could start after scoring the equaliser as a substitute against the Hammers, while Malo Gusto may be brought in to give captain Reece James a rest.

Christopher Nkunku scored in the third-round win over Morecambe and may get the nod over Nicolas Jackson, who has only managed one goal in his past 10 games.

Chelsea predicted XI (4-2-3-1, right to left): Jorgensen (GK) — Gusto, Adarabioyo, Colwill, Cucurella — Fernandez, Caicedo — Madueke, Palmer, Neto — Nkunku

Injured: Fofana (hamstring), Kellyman (hamstring), Lavia (hamstring), Badiashile (thigh)
Suspended: Mudryk (doping)

Brighton vs. Chelsea Prediction 
There has been no shortage of goals when the two sides meet. In their last five matches, they have scored 22 goals between them.

Chelsea have won each of their last five meetings against Brighton including a 4-2 win on the south coast in the Premier League back in September. Both sides have been in shaky form but Chelsea hold a slight advantage and should advance to the next round.

Prediction: Brighton 1-2 Chelsea
