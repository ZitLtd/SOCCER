It’s an all Premier League clash in the FA Cup fourth round as Brighton take on Chelsea in Saturday’s late kick off.

The Seagulls hope to get back to winning ways after an embarrassing 7-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest in their last outing and manager Fabian Hurzeler will hope a marquee win over Chelsea can boost his team’s confidence. Brighton cruised into this round of the competition with a 4-0 win over Norwich but Chelsea will be a wildly different test.

The Blues are expected to make plenty of changes for the game as Enzo Maresca juggles his squad and looks to give game time to players trying to recover from injuries. Chelsea’s 2-1 win over West Ham last time out sent them back into the Premier League’s top four and they’ll be hoping to continue that form into a strong cup run.

Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the match:

Carlos Baleba and Yasin Ayari both missed last Saturday's game against Nottingham Forest and are doubts for the game along with Pervis Estupinan.
